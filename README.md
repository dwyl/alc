# ALC > Awesome Learning Community<sup>1</sup>

Awesome Learning Community (ALC) helps everyone track and share everything they learn!

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

@**dwyl** we ***love learning***! (*which is why* ***we share*** all the ***things we learn***: https://github.com/docdis* )
***Most*** of the ***people*** we know also ***love learning new things***!
(*we don't hang out with people who already know everything...*)  
We are *frustrated* that we don't have a way of
tracking all the things we have learned
and *don't have* ***instant access*** to an "archive" of all our knowledge...  
Sure, we can "Google" for things to refresh our memory when we
forget something. But what happens when you don't have Google...?!
(*shock-horror! you could be offline...!*)

Wouldn't it be ***awesome*** if there was a ***complete list*** of ***everything you ever learned*** from day one of your life...?
What if all the things you know were instantly searchable (*with auto-completion & typo-correction*) and ***easily shareable*** with
anyone (*or kept* ***private*** *from marketers trying to sell you stuff*!) and you had a "***to-learn***" **list** with
everything you want to learn for a ***specific goal*** in life...?


## *Potential* Features [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/alc/issues)

We know there will be ***many awesome features*** others will
want. Here's a quick list of some of the things we think might be useful:

If you have an idea for a feature,
or want to help us prioritize which bit of functionality we build first/next, please see: https://github.com/dwyl/alc/issues

<sup>1</sup> ALC is a *working title*.
I'm *sure* someone will come up with a better name for this!
