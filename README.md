## *Potential* Features

Jotted down a few "requirements" last year...
none of them are "original" thoughts.
I credit [Owen White](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=9316117) for hiring me to work on his "Progress 360" project while at Pearson.
These are *general* features of a collaborative learning platform.
Sadly the product @tonydaly and I built while we were @Pearson was mothballed when Owen left (in the great re-org of 2014...) which is why I ***never*** want to work on *anything* ***closed-source again***!!
"Progress 360" which became the "***tilr***" **MVP** had a *couple* of these features, namely people could post short updates on what they had learned and those were viewable by their friends. But the funding for Owen's project was cut and thus thus 99% of the features we *hoped* to build were never written.

I want to build an open source learning platform anyone can extend!
