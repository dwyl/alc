# ALC > Awesome Learning Community<sup>1</sup>

Awesome Learning Community (ALC) helps everyone track and share everything they learn!

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

@**dwyl** we ***love learning***! (*which is why* ***we share*** *all the* ***things we learn***: https://github.com/docdis )  
***Most*** of the ***people*** we know also ***love learning new things***!
(*we don't hang out with people who already know everything...*)  
We are *frustrated* that we don't have a way of
tracking all the things we have learned
and *don't have* ***instant access*** to an "archive" of all our knowledge...  
Sure, we can "Google" for things to refresh our memory when we
forget something. But what happens when you don't have Google...?!
(*shock-horror! you could be offline...!*)

Wouldn't it be ***awesome*** if there was a ***complete list*** of ***everything you ever learned*** from day one of your life...?
What if all the things you know were instantly searchable (*with auto-completion & typo-correction*) and ***easily shareable*** with
anyone (*or kept* ***private*** *from marketers trying to sell you stuff*!) and you had a "***to-learn***" **list** with
everything you want to learn for a ***specific goal*** in life...?

## Goals

+ Make the learning _**open and accessible to all**_. (_what will this take_?)
+ Help _anyone_ keep track of what they have learned
+ Share a Link to any type of content with a brief description of
what you can expect to learn from it.
+ Let people _vote_ on what things they found most useful.
+ See at a glance if there are _gaps_ in your knowledge
+ Get suggestions from your colleagues/friends what you should _**learn next**_
+ Have a _**prioritised list**_ of all the things you still want to learn
+ ***Real-time Collaboration*** with others learning similar things.
+ Record the collaboration for others to learn from (_don't lose learning!_)
+ Consider (_Build_) **Spam-Fighting Tools** from the Outset
(e.g. flagging a post as blatant
  [_link-farming_](https://moz.com/blog/whiteboard-friday-link-farming) or offensive content)
+ Content **translation**? (_english isn't the only spoken language_)
+ **Discoverability** - is Content Searchable (_findable_) or hard to find/surface?  
  (searching for great learning materials should be _as easy as googling for [cat pictures](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cat+funny&tbm=isch)_!)
+ **Mobile first** (_for obvious reasons_)
+ **Offline first** - _save content in localStorage for online viewing_
+ **Real-time First**  - _real-time interaction should not be an after-thought_
if we have on-site / in-app notifications these should be easy to configure/disable
(_nothing kills UX more than over-notifying people - e.g. when they need to be doing something else..._)
+ **Social** - _encourage_ people to be _social and collaborative_
but allow people to learn solo and anonymously if they prefer.

## *Potential* Features [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/alc/issues)

We know there will be ***many awesome features*** others will
want. Here's a quick list of some of the things we think might be useful:

If you have an _idea_ for a feature,
or want to help us prioritize which bit of functionality we build first/next, please see: https://github.com/dwyl/alc/issues

<sup>1</sup> ALC is a *working title*.
I'm *sure* someone will come up with a better name for this!
