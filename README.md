# ALC > Awesome Learning Community<sup>1</sup>

Awesome Learning Community (ALC) helps everyone track
and share everything they learn!

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

@**dwyl** we ***love learning***!
We think that the _pace_ at which the _people_
in an organization or team learn is the best predictor of success. <br />
(_which is why **we share** all the **things we learn**!
  see: https://github.com/dwyl?q=learn ..._)  

_**Most**_ of the **people** we know also _**love learning new things**_!
(_we don't hang out with people who already
["know-it-all"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know-it-all) ..._)  
We are *frustrated* that we don't have a way of
tracking all the things we have learned
and *don't have* ***instant access*** to an "archive" of all our knowledge...  
Sure, we can "Google" for things to refresh our memory when we
forget something. But what happens when you don't have Google...?!
(*shock-horror! you could be offline...!*)

Wouldn't it be _**awesome**_ if there was a _**complete list**_
of _**everything you ever learned**_ from day one of your life...?
What if all the things you know were instantly searchable
(_with auto-completion & typo-correction_) and _**easily shareable**_ with
anyone (_or kept **private** from marketers trying to sell you stuff!_)
and you had a "_**to-learn**_" **list** with
everything you want to learn for a _**specific goal**_ in life...?

## _What_?

For now this repo is just a collection of book summaries
for books that we recommend people dwyl-ing should read.
but when we have a bit more [time](https://github.com/dwyl/time)
we are going to _build_ an "App" to help _everyone_
track their learning progress ...  :hourglass:


## Goals

+ Make the learning _**open and accessible to all**_. (_what will this take_?)
+ Help _anyone_ keep track of what they have learned
+ Share a Link to any type of content with a brief description of
what you can expect to learn from it.
+ Let people _vote_ on what things they found most useful.
+ See at a glance if there are _gaps_ in your knowledge
+ Get suggestions from your colleagues/friends what you should _**learn next**_
+ Have a _**prioritised list**_ of all the things you still want to learn
+ ***Real-time Collaboration*** with others learning similar things.
+ Record the collaboration for others to learn from (_don't lose learning!_)
+ Consider (_Build_) **Spam-Fighting Tools** from the Outset
(e.g. flagging a post as blatant
  [_link-farming_](https://moz.com/blog/whiteboard-friday-link-farming)
  or offensive content)
+ Content **translation**? (_english isn't the only spoken language_)
+ **Discoverability** - is Content Searchable (_findable_)
  or hard to find/surface?  
  (_searching for great learning materials should be as easy as googling for
    [cat pictures](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cat+funny&tbm=isch) ..._!)
+ **Mobile first** (_for obvious reasons_)
+ **Offline first** - _save content in localStorage for online viewing_
+ **Real-time First**  - _real-time interaction should not be an after-thought_
if we have on-site / in-app notifications these
should be easy to configure/disable
(_nothing kills UX more than over-notifying people - e.g. when they
  need to be doing something else..._)
+ **Social** - _encourage_ people to be _social and collaborative_
but allow people to learn solo and anonymously if they prefer.

## *Potential* Features [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/alc/issues)

We know there will be ***many awesome features*** others will
want. Here's a quick list of some of the things we think might be useful:

If you have an _idea_ for a feature,
or want to help us prioritize which bit of functionality
we build first/next, please see: https://github.com/dwyl/alc/issues

<sup>1</sup> ALC is a *working title*.
I'm *sure* someone will come up with a better name for this!
